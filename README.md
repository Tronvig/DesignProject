# Matt Tronvig - Design Team Project Submission

Design Process: 
1- [Design Spec](https://github.com/Tronvig/DesignProject/raw/master/SPEC.md)

2- [Sketch (pen & pencil)](https://github.com/Tronvig/DesignProject/raw/master/public/assets/img/ux/Form-Creator-App_ui-sketch.png)

3- [Design (Sketch app)](https://github.com/Tronvig/DesignProject/raw/master/public/assets/img/ux/Form-Creator-App_v2.png)

Development: 

1- `npm install`
2- `gulp`

Gulp generates css & js to `public/assets/css` and `public/assets/js` from sass and js in `src/sass` and `src/js`. All other files are static. 

## Built with Fastshell & Skeleton

# Design Team Project

This outlines a recent problem we ran into and came up with a design solution for. We'd like to see how you would handle it. What is most important is gaining some insight into your design process and seeing how you work.

## Background

[BriteCore](http://www.britecore.com/) is a web-based platform insurance companies use to manage their business. Insurance is a form of risk management. Risks are anything that someone could incur a loss on. BriteCore has historically worked primarily with property-based risks (homes, farms, churches, etc.).

## Problem

Since BriteCore was created to work mostly with property-based insurance, the system is pretty rigid. It assumes that all risks are properties and have addresses. This makes it difficult for BriteCore to work with different forms of insurance like Automobile Policies, Cyber Liability Coverage (protection against hacking), or Prize Insurance (if someone gets a $1 million hole-in-one prize at a golf tournament, the golf course doesn't pay it, they have an insurance policy to cover them).

Any kind of insurance requires a certain amount of information to be collected from the customer in order to figure out how much the insurance policy will cost. These questions include things like:

- "How many square feet is the home" - For a Homeowners Policy
- "Have you had a speeding ticket in the last year" - For an automobile policy
- "When is your birthday" - For a life insurance policy

We need a way for insurance carriers to setup and manage the questions they are asking their customers.

## Primary Goal

We would like to see you come up with a solution that allows insurers to define their own custom inputs for any type of insurance. This will include creating a design to view and create input fields that will then be presented to users while they complete insurance applications.

Each input is expected to have a label, and most importantly a 'type'. This type will determine much about how the input is presented and it's UX. These types include, but are not limited to, 'date', 'number', 'currency', 'text', and 'select (multiple preset options with a single choice).'

We’re mostly interested in how well you design an interface that is extremely usable, functional and responsive. This means we would like to see work product from the entire design process, including sketches and mockups, with a focus on a solid UX. You should also create a single, static high-fidelty prototype in HTML/CSS for your design that showcases your UI abilities, and ability to deliver a polished final product.

Bonus Points for hooking up some interesting functionality using jQuery/javascript. Super bonus points for anything else you can come up with that would be really helpful for our clients using this design.

### Delivery

Your final deliverables will be:
- Documentation around your design process (Can be stored in a google drive folder you share)
- HTML/CSS Design Prototype

Please share progress along the way. We are most interested in seeing how you work as a designer and tackle challenges. The more you share, the more we can steer you and make sure you don’t waste any time.
